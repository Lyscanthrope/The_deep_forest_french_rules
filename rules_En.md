A map game of post-colonial weird fantasy.
A re-imagining of The Quiet Year.

# Chapter One: Gather

```
As the facilitator, read this entire book and complete the tasks outlined
in this chapter prior to inviting others to join you at the table.
```
## What This Is

This is a map-drawing game. You collectively explore the struggles of a
community of monsters, trying to rebuild and heal after driving off the human
occupiers. It’s a game about community, difficult choices, and decolonization.
When you play, you make decisions about the community, decisions that get
recorded on a map that is constantly evolving. Parts of the map are literal
cartography, while other parts are symbolic. Players work together to create and
steer this community, but they also play devil’s advocate and introduce problems
and tensions into the game.

## Supplies

The Deep Forest requires 2-4 players and 2-4 hours.

In addition, it requires:
•	A blank piece of letter-sized paper
•	Pencils, erasers, and several index cards
•	Six dice (smaller is better)
•	20 Contempt Tokens (possibly stones or glass beads)
•	A deck of regular playing cards
**•	The	Oracle** (which includes a page of reference cards)


## Preparing Your Space

Some preparation is required before you are ready to teach The Deep Forest to
others. Begin by clearing your table or play space of any unnecessary objects.
Aim for a minimal environment.

Separate the deck into the four suits (representing four seasons). Place each
in a separate stack. Place the blank piece of paper in the centre of the table - it
will become the map of your area. Around it, array the remaining supplies: the
pencils, dice, Contempt tokens, summary cards, and index cards.

On one index card, write two column headings - Adoptions and Taboos. On a
second index card, write the heading Names.

## A Fleeting Year

A full-length game of The Deep Forest tends to run 3-4 hours including teaching
time. If you’d prefer to play a shorter game, you can do so with this adjustment:
before play, remove 4 cards from each of the suits (which represent seasons).
Make sure to remove the Queen of Diamonds (Summer), and make sure to keep
the King of Spades (Winter) in the cards you play with.


# Chapter Two: Survey

```
As the facilitator, you will read the regular text of this chapter aloud
to the group, following the instructions written in italics.
```
## The Opening Story

Read aloud.

For a long time, our monstrous home was occupied by invading humans. Now,
finally, we’ve driven them off, and we’re left with this: a year of relative peace. One
quiet year, with which to dismantle their settlements and reclaim our lands. Come
Winter, a band of heroes will arrive and we might not survive the encounter. This
is when the game will end. But we don’t know about that yet. What we know is
that right now, in this moment, we monsters have an opportunity for healing and
self-discovery in our deep forest, away from human eyes.


## Explaining the Tools

Let’s start by familiarizing ourselves with our tools.

Point to the blank page. This is our map. Before playing, we’ll establish some of
the landscape and the monsters who live here. As we play, we’ll update the map
to reflect new discoveries, conflicts, and opportunities. Parts of the map will be
literal cartography and other parts will be symbolic. We’ll try to avoid writing
words on it, though common symbols are fine.

Throughout the game, we’ll all be responsible for drawing on this map. It’s fine to
draw poorly or crudely, but all of us are going to draw.

Point to the dice. These are project dice. When a monster starts a project, we’ll
place one on the map to note how many weeks it will take to finish. Each week,
they tick down by one. When a die reaches zero, the project is complete.

Point to the Contempt Tokens. These are Contempt Tokens. They represent any
tension and frustration that might arise between our monsters.

Point to the summary card. This is a summary card. It’ll remind us what to do
each week of The Deep Forest, and in what order.

## Explaining the Deck

# ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠

```
Spring Summer Autumn Winter
```
Point to the four suits in turn, and explain that they correspond to the four seasons.
Taking the stack of spades, show everyone the King of Spades.

When this card is drawn, the game will be over. It could come at any time during
Winter.

Shuffle the spades, and place them face-down on the table. Shuffle the clubs, and
place them on top. Repeat with diamonds, and finally with hearts. As you shuffle
each suit, remind the group of its season.


## Who We Are

We all have two roles to play in this game. The first is to speak for the members
of this community, and to care about their individual and collective fates.. The
second is to dispassionately introduce dilemmas, to provoke difficult situations
and see what comes of them. The Deep Forest asks us to move in between these
two roles.

The game will ask us to speak as various monsters in the community, and take
actions on their behalf. Each time we do so, we’ll indicate which monster we
are speaking or acting as. For the purposes of this text, “monster” can be either
a single monster or a clutch of smaller monsters who live together. When you
introduce a monster to the map, remember that it must be able to communicate
and act, albeit perhaps unclearly or through some sort of magical means.

We shouldn’t feel that any single viewpoint belongs to any one of us, and are
invited to speak for different monsters throughout the course of the game. By
explicitly calling out the actors and perspectives of the monsters, The Deep
Forest allows us to explore how individuals shape communities, as well as how
individuals cope with the scars of occupation.

We’ll also be presented with opportunities to introduce issues for the community
to deal with in the wake of the occupation. This will often happen when we draw
cards or use the Uncover Something Old action. By dispassionately introducing
dilemmas, and then returning to our other role as members of the community,
we create tension and make the community’s struggles feel real. If there’s an issue
you struggle with in real life (like whether a space can be truly safe), introduce
situations that call it into question.


## Sketching Occupation

Before the game begins, we must establish the nature of the occupation and the
lingering impact it has had on the area. We begin with a brief discussion (taking
four minutes at most) about what the humans built here during the occupation.
This can be as simple as someone saying, “how about a military outpost and
barracks?” and everyone else nodding in agreement.

Once the general nature of the occupation has been decided, we choose a
player to draw a notable landmark that the humans left behind. This might
be a lighthouse, giant statue, or adobe church. It is best to keep this drawing
small and simple. Next, the remaining players demarcate the borders of the
occupation. This might mean drawing several rectangles to represent fenced-in
fields, or a wide trapezoidal shape to represent a human village. These borders
aren’t an exhaustive inventory of the occupation, but rather a starting point for
understanding its impact.

One player should introduce a landmark, and then the rest of the players should
demarcate the borders of the occupation, before proceeding.

## Introducing Monsters

At this point, each of us should introduce one monster and tell us briefly about
its nest or dwelling. When we introduce our monster and its home, we then
sketch our contribution onto the map. These sketches should be rough and
simple, leaving lots of blank space for additions during play. We each introduce
one monster this way, but it is understood that there are additional monsters in
our community, perhaps a half dozen that are as-yet unnamed.

As an example, a group might decide to set their game in the shadow of a
wizard’s tower. The first player introduces a monster: “Alright, a clutch of
kobolds, the Eidoo, has taken up residence in the old stables.” The next player
adds, “A hill ogre, Tezog, lives in the quarry a short distance away from the
tower.” The third player adds, “A clutch of tree sprites called the Wisps has carved
out several trees at the edge of the clearing as a nest.” The final player says, “A
ball of radiant light has taken up residence at the bottom floor of the tower. It
communicates with feelings, but the other monsters call it Sol.” As details are
added, the players draw them on the map. Record the names on your index card.

Everyone should introduce a monster and add it to the map before proceeding.


## Adoptions and Taboos

Next, we each declare an important remnant left behind by the humans,
something which we might have either adopted as our own or declared taboo
after the occupation.

Some examples are:
•	aqueducts and canals
•	a dark orb of farsight
•	a human memorial
•	domesticated animals
•	crops and fields

Identifying a human remnant makes it both alien and important. If you
pick “alloy metals,” you’re indicating that monsters didn’t have access to that
technology before the occupation and that there might be some usefulness for
that remnant now.

As a group, we now choose one of those remnants to be an Adoption. It gets
listed on the index card under Adoption, and whoever called it now draws
something on the map to represent how the monsters have adopted that human
remnant into their lives. The other remnants get listed as Taboos, and the players
who called them draw something on the map to represent the community’s
fear and distrust of those resources. Remember that symbols and symbolic
representations are fine, but words should be avoided.

Have everyone declare a human remnant and decide which one has been Adopted.
Update the map to reflect before proceeding.


# Chapter Three: Rules

```
Pass the book around the table, letting everyone take turns reading these
sections aloud to the group. Once you have finished this chapter, begin play.
```
## The Week

The basic unit of play in The Deep Forest is the week. Each week is a turn taken
by one player, with play proceeding clockwise around the table. Weeks should
take an average of 2-3 minutes to complete.

During each week, the following things happen:
•	The active player draws a card, reads the relevant text aloud,
and resolves it. They follow all bold text.
•	Project dice are reduced by 1, and any finished projects are updated.
•	The active player chooses and takes an action
(Uncover Something Old, Agree on Something, or Start a Project).

## Drawing Cards

As there are 52 cards, there are 52 weeks. We won’t necessarily get to play all
of them - the heroes could arrive any time during Winter to interrupt our
community’s progress.

Most cards have two options to choose from, separated by an ‘ o r ...’ divider. Pick
the option that you find the most interesting and fitting, and read the text aloud.
The card might ask you a question, bring bad news, or create new opportunities.
Many cards have specific rules attached to them, which are written in bold text. If
you drew the card, it’s up to you to make the decisions that the card requires.

If a card asks you a question, think about whether your answer could be
represented on the map somehow. If it fits, update the map to reflect this new
information. For example, if the card asks you about the feeding habits of the
community, you might end up drawing a hunting ground in the nearby woods.


## Working on Projects

Unless your card specifically told you otherwise (in bold text), the next step is
to reduce each project die on the map by 1. If a project reaches 0, the die gets
removed and the project is completed. Whoever started the project gets to tell
everyone how it turns out, and update the map to reflect its completion.

If a project finishes early (because a card says that “a project finishes early” in
bold text), it is instead the responsibility of the active player to tell everyone how
it turns out and to update the map.

If your card’s bold text had you place a project die on the map just a moment ago,
that die doesn’t reduce during this week. It’s just now getting under way.

When a project gets completed, it is assumed that it went successfully and
is beneficial to the community. In some cases, it might make sense to have
an investigative project end with a hope dispelled. Even in these cases, the
completion of a project should always feel like a step forward, not backward. This
doesn’t always mean that the whole community is happy with the results, though.

## Uncover Something Old

One of the action types is Uncover Something Old. Reveal something
from before or during the occupation. It might present a problem, offer an
opportunity, or a bit of both. Draw it on the map. Drawings should be small and
simple: smaller than an inch, finished within thirty seconds.

We can use this action to introduce unresolved issues and dilemmas, resurfacing
the history of the community. It might even be something that is familiar to the
community members but surprising to us as players. When individual monsters
get introduced through this action, we’ll give them names, and record those
names on our index card.

Some example situations:
•	A mass grave is found north of the community.
•	A pack of werebeasts emerges from the woods.
•	Forgotten tales of the end times start to circulate.
•	An ancient rite is completed for the first time since the occupation.
•	An archaic religious symbol appears in the sky.


## Agree on Something

Another of the action types is Agree on Something. Open with a statement about
a problem or issue in the community. Going clockwise, everyone else then gets to
weigh in once, sharing their agreement with your statement or describing what
their silence looks like. Remember to indicate which monster is speaking... or
not speaking.

Agreeing on Something never results in a concrete decision. Everyone weighs
in (or stays silent), and then it’s over. This is how conversations work in
communities: there is much left unsaid to preserve the peace.

Each agreement should be tied to a situation on the map. When an agreement
ends, mark the situation it is attached to with a small dot.

As an example, a community might agree on how to punish the ball of light
for failing to warn the community about problems at the wizard’s tower. The
first player says “The Eidoo say ‘We should punish Sol by locking him into the
tower.” The second player says “Tezog sits in silence, picking something from
his ear and then eating it, disinterested.” The third players says “The Wisps buzz
around and say ‘Yes! Sol is dangerous.” The fourth player says “Sol radiates grief,
but stays silent.”

It’s important that we stay concise. If any of us feel like we have more to say on a
topic, we can always Agree on Something about it at a later point.


## Start a Project

The final action type is Start a Project. You choose a situation on the map,
and tell us how some of the monsters address it. It doesn’t matter if the entire
community supports the project or not - work begins. Projects might focus
on decolonization efforts, the restoration of old customs or edifices, or new
endeavors that will move the community forward.

Some example projects:
•	The mud wurms & Rothwen begin dismantling the fences that the humans built.
•	We’re teaching the draken tongue to our village young.
•	Sordid leads several others in restoring the runic arches.

As a group, quickly decide how many weeks the project would reasonably take to
complete (minimum 1 and maximum 6). Remember that you are a community
in recovery. Many of your powers have lain dormant, and your traditions
acquired stigma. Is your community prepared to tackle this project? Must
healing and practice transpire first? Be generous with your assumptions, but do
remember that your community needs to build capacity slowly.

Place a die on the map wherever the project is taking place, with the die face
matching the number of weeks it will take to complete.

## Updating Remnants

At the start of the game, we’ll have Adopted one remnant and declared at
least that many to be Taboo. These lists serve as guides for interpreting the
community’s ongoing discourse about the occupation. Throughout play, we’ll
update these lists to reflect changes in our perspective, whenever we feel that it is
appropriate to do so. Maybe the completion of a project induces an Adoption or
sparks a Taboo. Some weekly cards will alter these lists as well.


## Balancing the Actions

Uncover Something Old lets us introduce situations and dilemmas into the game,
uncovering the time before and during the occupation. Agree on Something
lets us all talk about the state of the map and the dominant opinions of the
community. Start a Project lets us solve our problems and grow. By respecting
this division of purpose, we make sure each week involves making important
decisions.

It’s important that we respect the purpose and balance of the three types of
action. We shouldn’t use Uncover Something Old to skirt our problems by
conveniently encountering the very supplies we lacked. We shouldn’t Agree on
Something about situations we haven’t even mentioned or introduced yet.

## Contempt

If ever you feel like a particular monster wasn’t consulted or honoured in a
decision-making process, you can take a piece of Contempt and place it at the
edge of the map, nearest the lair of the monster you feel was overlooked or
ignored. If someone starts a project that you don’t agree with, you don’t get to
voice your objections or speak out of turn. You are instead invited to place a piece
of Contempt.

Contempt will generally remain on the map for the rest of the game. It will act
as a reminder of past contentions and slights, signs of discord within a diverse
community. In addition, you can discard it back into the centre of the table in
two ways: by acting selfishly and by diffusing tensions.

If a monster ever wants to act selfishly, to the known detriment of the
community, you can remove a Contempt token to justify the behaviour. You
decide whether the behaviour requires justification. This will often trigger others
placing Contempt tokens in response.

If someone else does something that you think a monster would greatly support,
that would mend relationships and rebuild trust, you can remove a Contempt
token to demonstrate how they have diffused past tensions.


## Death

Every death has the potential to drastically change the community. When a
monster dies, take a moment to think about the repercussions that might crop up.

If this was the last monster involved with a project, we can decide that the project
is abandoned. If that’s the case, we’ll remove the project die from the map. If
others continue to work on it, it continues as before. The death of a monster
could also have an impact on our Taboos and Adoptions. If a superstitious monster
dies, does something cease to be Taboo? If a knowledgeable monster dies, do we
still know how to maintain an Adoption? We can modify these lists as needed.

## Restraint

In playing The Deep Forest, we must refrain from free-wheeling discussion
about what to do next. There are specific mechanics in the game for discussing
community issues and demonstrating our displeasure. When we play, we won’t
speak out of turn or attempt to circumnavigate these mechanics. These rules work
to demonstrate how difficult it is to engage the entire community in conversation,
and how tensions and disagreements tend to linger across weeks or even months.

## Pacing

At the beginning of the game, we’ll only have a basic sketch of the landscape and
scarce information about the monsters who live here. From this humble place, a
rich tapestry will emerge. How, and at what pace?

The cards of Spring will prompt introspection, reminding us that the occupation
left us forever changed. We should use Spring to become familiar with the
mechanics and structure of the game. There won’t necessarily be a lot of tension
or conflict during Spring, and this is fine. In Summer, our community’s unity
will be tested. As the monsters who live here regain their footing, old conflicts
resurface and new dramas emerge. In Autumn, the larger world will start to
intrude upon our home, bringing with it hopes and dangers. In Winter, the
community will continue its work and preparations, and as players we will contend
with the dramatic irony of knowing that the heroes could arrive at any moment.

If ever the map feels lacking or the monsters seem to have resolved the issues
already raised, we can introduce new dilemmas. What happens when a
monster destroys a key resource? What happens when someone is accused of
collaborating with the humans?


# Chapter Four: More

```
As the facilitator, be familiar with these sections. During play, you may reference
and read sections from it whenever they seem relevant or important.
```
## Parsing

Should you feel that someone has misinterpreted the rules, pause them. Find
the relevant section of the text and read it aloud. As much as possible, call
attention to how the rules function, rather than why you think a specific
player has misused them. Allow players to be the ultimate arbiters of their own
contributions.

## Immigration

When new monsters arrive to the community, it’s best that they also comes
as solitary individuals or small clutches. The Deep Forest takes on a radically
different tone if suddenly three dozen orcs arrive in a community that may only
have eight or nine monsters total. Make sure that your additions challenge the
community, but don’t unbalance it so completely that one set of monsters is the
dominant group by numbers alone.

## The Heroes Arrive

During play, it’s best to leave the heroes an elusive mystery - perhaps hinting at
what they might be, but never directly answering. The game ends abruptly when
the King of Spades is drawn. The card is read aloud, and the game immediately
concludes. Once the game is over, it is fine to talk about what the heroes might
have been, what their arrival might have meant for the community, or any of the
other situations that were faced throughout their year. With the game over, the
limits placed on communication and discussion are suddenly lifted.


# Design Notes

```
from Avery Alder Mcdaldno.
```
I grew up largely oblivious to my surroundings, and especially to the histories
and oppressions that resided in them. I didn’t really understand, growing up,
that I was occupying Kootenay/Ktunaxa and Sinixt space. I moved to Vancouver
without understanding that it was unceded Coast Salish territory, that it belonged
to the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waluth people. And then I wrote The
Quiet Year without understanding the ways that its design tacitly replicated
colonial narratives of ownership and ‘unclaimed’ land.

Part of my desire to write The Deep Forest was to address that last one, to create
a Quiet Year that centred upon decolonization. But I also wanted to explore
something more familiar to me, queer and trans - the ways that otherness and
monstrosity are sometimes reclaimed or leveraged in the process of coming to
know ourselves.

Elena Rose wrote a piece called **on cartography and dissection** , touching on both
colonialism and queerness, and words from it jump to mind now -

```
“You hear, across the water, those words: Here Be Monsters. You hear them
inking it onto you, steering well clear of your borders or making a beeline
for savage lands to tame and profit from. You know your insides are not
navigable. You know that no matter how you say, look, I can tell you where
you are, you’re right here, all you will hear back is a new name given to you,
the Undiscovered Country.
```
```
Wave your arms and shout, if you like. I’m doing it too. You’ll still hear the
question: What are you?
I’m not a what.
Yeah, but what are you?”
```
I wanted to write a game about the ways that collective recovery can shape a
community - bringing people together or fracturing them, erasing difference or
forcing us to see it more clearly.


# Design Notes

```
from Mark Diaz Truman.
```
I didn’t really think about being a Mexican-American game designer until after
I had already written two games. It literally never occurred to me that I might
have something to say about my own experience growing up as a Hispanic kid
in New Mexico, the state famous for the Pueblo Revolt. My games were just like
everyone else’s games.

While designing The Deep Forest, Avery introduced me to a Junot Diaz quote
that was particularly apt -

```
“You know, vampires have no reflections in a mirror? [...] And what I’ve
always thought isn’t that monsters don’t have reflections in a mirror. It’s
that if you want to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the
cultural level, any reflection of themselves. And growing up, I felt like a
monster in some ways. I didn’t see myself reflected at all.”
```
It’s strange, I think, what a lack of mirrors does to a person. You know that you
have a story, but since you can’t see it outside of yourself, maybe you’re just crazy?
Maybe you should get on with the process of stamping out whatever Other is left
inside you before everyone else realizes that you’re something different.

I wanted to design a game that drew out decolonization as a process of recovery,
a slow growth from one mindset to another. It’s not what came before, largely
because what came before was destroyed, but it holds the potential for a healing.
Yet like many attempts at decolonization, we know it will be cut short long before
it can truly finish.

My hope is that The Deep Forest is a mirror, one that reflects back what you bring
to it, the roles you traditionally play and the conquests you traditionally attempt.
